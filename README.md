## Nonlethality
Range/melee does not affect lethality.  Psychic damage can be made nonlethal without issue; targets will drop to 0 and be stable.  Bludgeoning damage can be made nonlethal if it is the result of an attack roll, and targets will drop to 0 and be stable.  Necrotic damage canot be specified to be nonlethal.  Piercing, Slashing, and all other types of damage can be made nonlethal if and only if the damage was dealt as the result of an attack roll.  If such an attack reduces the target to 0, the creature drops unconscious and unstable, making death saving throws according to player rules.  PCs at 0 HP will follow RAW for the most part, with one exception - if an NPC makes a nonlethal Bludgeoning or Psychic attack against a PC and they drop to 0, the PC will be immediately stable.

## Incapacitated damage
If a creature is incapacitated for any reason, it cannot benefit from a DEX bonus to its AC.  
If a creature is indefinitely incapacitated and there is no other threat around, any lethal attack roll that would deal damage is an instant kill.  
If a creature is incapacitated for any reason in the middle of active combat, any attack has advantage, and any hit from within 5ft. is a critical.  
If a creature is incapacitated for an arbitrary amount of time but will not be incapacitated once attacked (e.g. sleeping), any attack has advantage, and any hit is a critical.  
If a creature is incapacitated for a limited amount of time outside of combat via a spell or other magical effect (e.g. Hold Person), any attack from within 5ft. will automatically hit, any other attack has advantage, and any hit is a critical.

## Ranged Dual Wielding
One-handed Light ranged weapons can be wielded in the off hand, and a bonus action can be used to attack as if using the Two Weapon Fighting mechanics.  
The ranged weapon does not have to be Light if the wielder has the Dual Wielder feat, but the +1 to AC will not apply unless both weapons are melee weapons.  
The Crossbow Expert feat does not apply to guns.  

## Enchanting (setting specific)
Enchanting an item first requires that you understand the formula for putting that enchantment on that item and are able to cast the spell you are trying to enchant the item with.  
Cantrip enchantments are incredibly cheap and usually only take a single ritual that takes an hour + the casting time of the spell (though it does require you know the spell you're enchanting with).  
Higher level spells are more difficult, and require more than one performance of the enchanting ritual (potentially becoming ridiculously expensive for spells which require costly material components).  
Most of the uses of the ritual will be to prepare the item to recieve the enchantment in a final ritual potentially taking way longer (anywhere from 3 to 13 hours).  
There is no limit to how many times you can perform the preparation ritual other than spell slots and time.  
There is always a chance the final ritual will fail; the chance gets exponentially higher with high level spells and steadily lower with more casts of the preparation ritual.  
Consumables such as scrolls and potions are similarly easy to craft.  
To enchant anything, you need Enchanting Tools.  Wizards and Artificers have proficiency for free, any other character can optionally choose it as an Artisan Tool proficiency with their class or background.

## Disenchanting (setting specific)
It is possible to learn an item's enchantment formula by disenchanting it if you are proficient in Arcana.  This will most likely destroy the item beyond repair, and is not guaranteed to actually teach you the full formula.  
If you wish to get rid of the enchantment on an item without breaking it, there are two ways:
* Performing the enchantment ritual with the Dispel Magic spell, and making an Arcana check with a DC of 10 + spell level
* Breaking the object and fixing it again, either with Mending or just plain glue 

## Action Economy
It is possible to use an Action on your turn to use an ability that would normally be a Bonus Action or Reaction, and it is possible to use your Bonus Action on your turn to use an ability that would normally be your Reaction.  

## Spells in Combat
If you cast more than one spell on your turn, their combined level must not add up to more than the highest level spell slot you have.  Cantrips count as level 0.

## Potions
Drinking a potion in combat is a bonus action.  Feeding a Potion to another character is an Action.  
If you are currently under the effect of at least one potion, drinking another non-instant potion will require a Consititution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the combined spell levels of all relevent potions.  On a success, the new potion takes effect.  On a failure you throw up, can't benefit from the new potion, and attacks against you have advantage until the start of your next turn.

## Identifying Magic Items
An Arcana check can reveal whether an item has magical properties or not, and sometimes part of the nature of the magic if the effects are readily apparent.  Focusing on an item over a short rest does not reveal the nature of the item unless you attune to it.  
See the specific spell changes for information on Identify and Detect Magic.

## Cursed Items
Cursed items have two main properties that set them apart from other magic items:
* They cannot be de-attuned (and sometimes cannot be physically removed) unless targeted by specific spells such as Remove Curse or Greater Restoration.
* They may or may not have abilities that are not learned at the time of initial attunement.

Not all "Cursed" items have negative effects, and some "non-cursed" items may have negative effects.  Cursed items can be created either on purpose or by weird stuff happening in an enchantment ritual.

## Preparing Spells
Spells can be prepared soon after the end of a long rest or during a short rest.  This process takes 1 minute per spell level per spell (both the spells you're preparing and un-preparing), and requires concentration and the ability to perform verbal and somatic components for the duration.  If a spell requires material components or a focus, it cannot be prepared without the material components or focus present.

## Extra Features
All spells, all feats, and most backgrounds from the PHB, EE, XGE, and SCAG are available, though some have changes listed below.  Any backgrounds that are setting-specific and any UA material requires DM approval before using.  The current setting uses an extremely customized version of Artificer; it takes precedence over the UA version.  Items not from official WotC material require heavy DM scutiny to be accepted.  

## Ninth Level Spells
9th level spells can only be cast by literal Gods.  If you level up to the point where you have a 9th level spell slot and have the opportunity to learn a spell, it cannot be of 9th level.  However, you can still upcast lower level spells using your 9th level slot.

## Cantrips as 1st Level Spells
Apart from cantrips that have been selected via RAW, the cantrip list for each class can be treated as an extension of the class' first level spell list.

## Scrolls
You do not need to have a spell on your class' spell list in order to actually use a scroll with that spell.  However, magic is broken down into two categories: Divine and Arcane.  If you are a Divine caster, you can use any spell scroll scribed by another Divine caster.  If you are an Arcane caster, you can use any scroll scribed by another Arcane caster.  
Wizards, Sorcerers, Bards, Artificers, Eldritch Knights, and Arcane Tricksters are Arcane casters.  
Druids, Rangers, Clerics, and Paladins are Divine casters.  
Warlocks can be either, depending on Patron (but usually are Divine).  
If you do not have a spell slot high enough to cast a spell on a scroll, you still need to roll a spellcasting check to use it.

## Social Encounters
Active Persuation can only be rolled against a PC if the PC is Charmed/under a Friends spell (in which case the check is made without advantage), or to contest an Insight check.

## Companion Creatures
If you have a telepathic connection with a companion creature that you control and that creature rolls initiative at the same time as you, that creature does not roll initiative for itself, and instead acts on your turn.

## Fallen Classes
If a character loses the favor of an entity that granted them powers and has them stripped away, all the character's levels in the relevent class will be replaced by one level of a "Fallen x" class, and their XP will be reset down to the minimum amount for their new character level.  The "Fallen x" class will include every nonmagical feature the character had gained up until that point, including HP and Hit Dice, but not including Proficiency Bonus.  Subsequently gained levels in other classes will not grant new HP or Hit Dice until the character has surpassed the character level at which they fell.  If the character does not already have levels in any other classes at the time they fall, they do not need to meet the prerequisites to multiclass into any other class, but must still have a valid roleplay reason to multiclass.

## Magic Item Types (setting specific)
There are three types of magic items: Artifacts, Relics, and Modern Items.  Artifacts are practically indestructable and very powerful, but are extremely rare (for example, the Frozen Stone).  Relics are magic items enchanted during the crafting process, and can produce a wide range of effects (for example, the Bag of Holding).  Modern Items are enchanted post-crafting through a series of rituals, and usually just recreate a spell's effects directly (for example, Blade Warded Armor).  All enchanting/disenchanting rules in this list apply solely to Modern Items.

## Travel Paces
Pace | Speed | Effects
-----|-------|--------
Slow|2 days/hex|+5 to passive perception, can stealth
Standard|1 hex/day|cannot stealth
Fast|2 hexes/day|-5 to passive perception, cannot stealth

Travel on main roads halves travel time.  Travel though difficult terrain (hills, forest) doubles travel time if not on a main road.  Ships and Airships cannot travel at a Fast pace except with magical help.

## Fall Damage
Falling damage compounds: 1d6 per 10ft fallen, per 10ft fallen. (Example: falling 40ft will deal 4d6+3d6+2d6+1d6)

The maximum remains at 200ft, or 210d6.

If your speed is greater than 0 when you hit the ground, you can make an Acrobatics check (DC=10+{feet fell}/10) to reduce your effective fall distance by 10ft before damage is rolled.

## Inspiration
When you spend your inspiration, you can get an ability or spell that your class will have in the next two levels, for up to one round.  If you are multiclassed, you instead choose an ability or spell one level ahead from any of your classes.  

If you are planning to multiclass with your next level, you may choose from the level 1 abilities of that class, but must use your next level to multiclass.  Similarly, if you use an ability that you would have had to choose when leveling, you are locked into that choice for when you level up, and cannot spend future inspiration on conflicting options.

## Downtime
You can use downtime days to gain abilities beyond those listed in your class.  You must have some roleplay reason to want the abilities, a roleplay justification for how you're leanring, and must describe at least partially what you are doing during downtime to train.  You may train on your own for free (minus required materials), but the training will go faster if you train under someone who has the feature you are training to get.  Each downtime day requires approximately 8 hours of uninturrupted training.

Ability | Days Required | Comments
-----|-------|--------
Weapon Proficiency|30 days|none
Language|~40 days|time may vary
Skill/Tool Proficiency|80 days|none
Skill/Tool Expertise|120 days|requires skill proficiency
Armor Proficiency|120 days|requires previous tier proficiency
Feat|240 days|none
Level Up|variable|proficiency bonus\*100 XP per downtime day
Other Class Feature|variable|Depends on DM judgement calls

Each downtime day training under someone with proficiency will count as two downtime days towards the total.  If they have expertise in the tool/skill, it will count triple, but likely cost more.  Prices may vary depending on in-story context.  If you want a specific class feature, it will require training under someone of the relevent class.

## Multiclassing
If you want to multiclass, please let me know well in advance, and I will leave bread crumbs here and there for you.  You will need a very solid roleplay reason to want to multiclass, and another solid roleplay excuse for how you will gain the new class features.  If you multiclass into any "learned" class, you will need to spend downtime training in your new class features.  In the time directly leading up to and after your multiclass, I will slowly give you the level one features of that class depending on how you roleplay it.

## Specific Spell Changes
* Magic Missile: If prepared as a first level spell, it can be cast as an Action without using a spell slot.  Casting it this way creates only a single dart.
* Teleportation Circle: No longer completely consumes the chalk and ink, but the chalk and ink lasts for at most 50 castings before they must be replaced (basically making it 1 gp per cast).  Permanent Circles can be created using the homebrewed Enchantment rules or RAW
* Plane Shift: Attuning the forked rod to other planes is a very precise process that requires either good research or experimentation.  The resonant frequency of the Material Plane is known by high-level casters and not that difficult to research if you know where to look, but the resonant frequency of other planes is still being studied.  The rod itself costs about 250 gp in materials and a successful Smithing check to craft, but cannot be crafted without knowledge of the proper frequency for the target plane, which cannot be studied from anywhere but that plane.  The more obscure the plane is and the further it is from the Prime Material, the more difficult the Smithing check to craft the rod.
* Armor of Agathys: While you have the temporary HP, you also have resistance to cold damage.
* Identify: Can identify curses if and only if the cursed item was enchanted with an equal or lower spell level than the one used to cast Identify.  Ritual casting Identify makes it count as 1st level.
* Detect Magic: Does not give the 'school' of magic, it instead gives the 'general nature' of the magic.  Sometimes this can be specific enough to identify the enchantment, other times it's more generic and useless than the school.
* Control Flames: Can be used on magical flames under the caster's control
* Find Steed: Steed can take the form of any Large or Medium Beast of CR 1 or lower, with no Fly or Swim speed, and that the caster has seen before.
* Find Greater Steed: Steed can take the form of any Large or Medium non-bipedal naturally-occuring creature of CR 2 or lower that the caster has seen before.
* Find Familiar: Familiar can take the form of any Tiny or Small CR 0 Beast that the caster has seen before
* Barkskin: Does not require concentration
* Stoneskin: Grants resistance to non-siege Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing damage, and grants a damage threshold of 5 for all types of damage except for Psychic and Poison.
* Sending: If you use the Sending spell to contact someone who knows you by a fake identity, they interpret it as coming from the identity they know.  If the recipent knows multiple identities belonging to the caster but does not know that they are the same person, the caster can decide which identity the Sending spell will use.
* Healing Spirit: Moving the spirit is a free action on your turn; healing requires a Bonus Action.
* Ceremony: When cast on a sentient target, invokes a mission/journey within the target(s)' mind.  The benefits of the spell only happen if this mission is successful.  If there is a skill check involved in the casting, the skill check's results determine the difficulty of the mission.  In addition, it is possible to use the Ceremony spell for more than just the listed uses, though the benefits depend entirely on DM interpretation of the situation.

## Feat Changes
* Lucky: Whenever more than one d20 was rolled for something, the circumstances of the original roll must be finalized before choosing between the original die and the Luck die.  For example, if you roll with disadvantage and then use Luck, you cannot choose the higher of the two original rolls - you have to choose between the lower of the original ones or the Luck die.
* Tavern Brawler: With this feat, your Unarmed Strikes have the Finesse property.
* Sharpshooter: Instead of -5/+10, the tradeoff is -prof/+ 1d{2x prof} (e.g. -2/+1d4, -3/+1d6, etc.)
* Great Weapon Master: Instead of -5/+10, the tradeoff is -prof/+1d{2x prof} (e.g. -2/+1d4, -3/+1d6, etc.)
* Diplomat (UA): replace the third feature with "You learn the Charm Person spell, and can cast it at first level once per long rest without expending a spell slot.  Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell."
* Menacing (UA): replace the third feature with "You learn the Cause Fear spell, and can cast it at first level once per long rest without expending a spell slot.  Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell."
