## Action Economy
It is possible to use an Action on your turn to use an ability that would normally be a Bonus Action or Reaction, and it is possible to use your Bonus Action on your turn to use an ability that would normally be your Reaction.  

## Cantrips
Apart from cantrips that have been selected via RAW, the cantrip list for each class can be treated as an extension of the class' first level spell list.  In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, you may swap out one cantrip from that class each time you gain a level in the class that grants it.

## Changed Casting Stat
When you make a spellcasting character, multiclass into a spellcasting class, or otherwise gain the ability to cast spells from a class or feat, you may request for the class' spellcasting ability score to change to a different one, if you can give a solid roleplay reason for it.  For example, you may decide that your warlock gained their power through studying forgotten research of an eldritch entity, and thus uses Intelligence as their casting stat.  Once you start playing this character as a spellcaster, you may not change their casting stat.

If you are starting this character from level 1 with a different casting stat, you may change their starting saving proficiencies if they do not normally start with proficiency in saves from their new casting stat.  All characters must have one proficiency from the 3 more common saves (Dex, Wis, Con) and one proficiency from the 3 less common saves (Int, Cha, Str), so the save proficiency you replace must be in the same group as your new casting stat.

## Character Creation
For your background, you may choose any two skill proficiencies and any two tool/weapon proficiencies or languages, if you don't think the ones provided by whichever background you choose fit your character's backstory.  If you really want to, I can also create a custom background feature for you, but bear in mind that I have screwed that up before.

When rolling stats, use 4d6 drop lowest 6 times, and reroll all 6 if the total is less than 70.

You start with the equipment provided in your class features in addition to the starting wealth listed for your class.  If you are higher than level 3, you can also roll extra d4s equal to your proficiency bonus with your starting wealth.  You may spend starting wealth on anything in the PHB before the first session, and trade out starting equipment for extra starting wealth.

## Companion Creatures
If you have a telepathic connection with a companion creature that you control and that creature rolls initiative at the same time as you, that creature does not roll initiative for itself, and instead acts on your turn.

## Cursed Items
Cursed items have two main properties that set them apart from other magic items:
* They cannot be de-attuned (and sometimes cannot be physically removed) unless targeted by specific spells such as Remove Curse or Greater Restoration.
* They may or may not have abilities that are not learned at the time of initial attunement.

## Crit Damage
If you choose to add dice from a resource or ability after you hit instead of before, the additional dice are not doubled if the attack is a critical.

## Downtime
You can use downtime to gain abilities beyond those listed in your class.  You must have some roleplay reason to want the abilities, a roleplay justification for how you're learning, and must describe at least partially what you are doing during downtime to train.  You may train on your own for free (minus required materials), but the training will go faster if you train under someone who has the feature you are training to get.  Each downtime day requires approximately 8 hours of training, and gives a number of Downtime Points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).

Ability | Points Required | Comments
-----|-------|--------
Simple Weapon Proficiency|15|none
Martial Weapon Proficiency|30|none
Language|60|none
Skill/Tool Proficiency|80|none
Skill/Tool Expertise|90|requires skill proficiency
Armor Proficiency|120|requires previous tier proficiency
Half-Feat|120|feats that also give +1 to a stat; you don't get the +1 from the feat
+1 to an Ability Score|120|up to a maximum of 20
Feat|240|you may get portions of the feat over time
Other Class Feature|variable|depends on DM judgement calls

Each downtime day training under someone with proficiency will double the points you gain for that day.  If they have expertise in the tool/skill and are teaching you mere proficiency, it will count triple.  Prices for training may vary depending on in-story context.  If you want a specific class feature, it will require training under someone of the relevant class.

## Drawing Weapons Magically
If you have a class feature that says you can magically conjure or summon a weapon in your hand, it counts as a free object interaction, similar to actually drawing a weapon.

## Dual Creature Types
Some creatures may have 2 separate creature types, determined on a case-by-case basis by the DM.  As such, they are affected by anything that affects either of their creature types.  However, if one of their creature types is immune to an effect but the other isn't, the effect is reduced in a way determined by the DM.  For example, Warforged would be classified as both Construct and Humanoid, and would have advantage on saves vs Hold Person and similar magical effects.  

Planetouched races such as Tieflings and Aasimar (as well as Dhampirs) are considered purely Humanoid, but with non-humanoid heritage that is divinable by certain spells and magical effects.  Undead creatures will never retain any semblance of their previous creature type, apart from appearance.

## Extended Sourcebooks
Spells, Feats, and Backgrounds from all officially published WotC material are available, though some have changes listed below.  All UA material and any features that are setting-specific require DM approval and possible modification before using.

Items not from official WotC material require heavy DM scutiny to be accepted, and may be reworked on the fly.  

## Fall Damage
Falling damage compounds: 1 die per 10ft fallen, per 10ft fallen.  All creatures' fall damage caps at 100ft (55 dice), but the damage dice change based on the creature's size - the bigger you are, the harder you fall.
* Tiny creatures take 1 damage per 10ft, to a maximum of 55 points
* Small creatures take 1d4 damage per 10 ft, to a maximum of 55d4
* Medium creatures take 1d6 damage per 10 ft, to a maximum of 55d6
* Large creatures take 1d8 damage per 10 ft, to a maximum of 55d8
* Huge creatures take 1d10 damage per 10 ft, to a maximum of 55d10
* Gargantuan creatures take 1d12 damage per 10 ft, to a maximum of 55d12

If your speed is greater than 0 when you hit the ground, you can make a Dexterity saving throw (DC=10+{feet fell}/10) to reduce your effective fall distance by 10ft before damage is rolled.  Evasion does not apply to this save.  If you have resistance or immunity to nonmagical bludgeoning damage, it applies to fall damage unless specifically stated otherwise.

## Fallen Classes
If a Paladin, Cleric, or Warlock loses the favor of an entity that granted them powers, the player may have those powers stripped away.  All the character's levels in the relevent class will be replaced by one level of a "Fallen x" class.  The "Fallen x" class will include every nonmagical class feature the character had gained up until that point, including HP and Hit Dice, but not including Proficiency Bonus.  Subsequently gained levels in other classes will not grant new HP or Hit Dice until the character has surpassed the character level at which they fell, nor will they grant ASIs until the new classes' ASIs outnumber the ASIs they had under the first class.  If the character does not already have levels in any other classes at the time they fall, they do not need to meet the ability score prerequisites to multiclass into any other class, but must still have a valid roleplay reason to take the new class.

## Firearms
Firearms in this campaign are based around the type of firearm used in Matt's Gunslinger subclass.  For right now, the firearm table in the 1.3 Gunslinger sheet is the canon firearm table for the setting.

## Hit Points
When rolling a hit die on a level up, if the die lands on a 1, you may reroll it until it lands on anything else.

## Identifying Magic Items
An Arcana check may reveal whether an item has magical properties or not, and sometimes part of the nature of the magic if the effects are readily apparent.  Focusing on an item over a short rest does not reveal the nature of the item unless you attune to it.  
See the specific spell changes for information on Identify and Detect Magic.

Not all "Cursed" items have negative effects, and some "non-cursed" items may have negative effects.  Cursed items can be created either on purpose or by weird stuff happening in an enchantment ritual.

## Inspiration
(Removed pending the Interim Campaign)

## Incapacitation
If a creature is incapacitated for any reason, it cannot benefit from a DEX bonus to its AC.  
If a creature is indefinitely incapacitated and there is no other threat around, any lethal attack that would deal damage and could kill the target is an instant kill.  

## Milestone Leveling
XP will not be kept track of, or given out.  All PCs will be the same level, regardless of deaths, and the PCs will level upon a DM judgement call.  If a player is a Fallen Cleric, Paladin, or Warlock, they will gain levels slightly faster until they catch back up.

## Multiclassing
If you want to multiclass, please let me know well in advance, and I will leave bread crumbs here and there for you.  You will need a roleplay reason to want to multiclass, and another roleplay excuse for how you will gain the new class features.  If you multiclass into any "learned" class, you will need to spend at least some downtime training for your new class features.  In the time directly leading up to and after your multiclass, I may slowly give you the level one features of that class depending on how you roleplay it.  Alternatively, if you are multiclassing into a 'gifted power' class, you will gain most of your level one features at once when it happens in the roleplay.

The multiclass prerequisites can be changed around or ignored depending on your primary ability scores for your build.  For example, you do not need 13 Str to multiclass as a paladin if you use Dexterity for all your attack rolls, but you would need 13 Dex.  Bear in mind that I am more lenient with the prerequisites to multiclass out of a class than the prerequisites for multiclassing in.

## Ninth Level Spells
(Removed pending the Interim Campaign)

## Nonlethality
Range/melee does not affect lethality.  Psychic and Lightning damage can be made nonlethal without issue; targets will drop to 0 and be stable.  Bludgeoning damage can be made nonlethal if it is the result of an attack roll, and targets will drop to 0 and be stable.  Necrotic damage canot be specified to be nonlethal.  All other types of damage can be made nonlethal if and only if the damage was dealt as the result of an attack roll.  If such an attack reduces the target to 0, the creature drops unconscious and unstable, making death saving throws according to player rules.  PCs at 0 HP will follow RAW for the most part, with one exception - if a PC takes nonlethal Bludgeoning, Lightning, or Psychic damage and they drop to 0, the PC will be immediately stable.

## Potions
Drinking a potion in combat is a bonus action.  Feeding a Potion to another character is an Action.  

## Preparing Spells
Spells can be prepared soon after the end of a long rest or during a short rest.  This process takes 1 minute per spell level per spell (both the spells you're preparing and un-preparing), and requires concentration and the ability to perform verbal and somatic components for the duration.  If a spell requires material components or a focus, it cannot be prepared without the material components or focus present.

## Ranged Dual Wielding
One-handed Light ranged weapons can be wielded in the off hand, and a bonus action can be used to attack as if using the Two Weapon Fighting mechanics.  
The ranged weapon does not have to be Light if the wielder has the Dual Wielder feat, but the +1 to AC will not apply unless both weapons are melee weapons.  
The Crossbow Expert feat does not apply to guns.  

## Resurrection
After being resurrected via Revivify, Raise Dead, or similar magic, you automatically have one failed death save.  After being resurrected twice, you have two permanently failed death saves.  After being resurrected for a third time, the next time you would normally be unconscious and unstable, you die instantly and cannot be revived.  This restriction does not apply to Zealot Barbarians, the Reincarnate spell, or Undead.

## Sailing
Most of the rules and statblocks from the UA Ships at Sea will now be used for sailing rules.  This includes travel paces, combat speeds, crash damage, ship stats and parts, and crew roles.  The following modifications to the UA are as follows:
* Morale and Mutiny will be handled by RP, with no "crew quality score" or similar values
* Skill checks while sailing are based on the relevent tool or skill, using the proficiency bonus of whoever's leading that task, but may be made using the ship's stats.
* Full Speed Ahead and Fire At Will cannot be used.
* In-combat repairs as an Action can use a DC 15 Carpenter's Tools check to regain 2d6 hull HP, or 8d6 hull HP with the Fabricate spell (requires Carpenter's Tools proficiency), or 1 HP with Mending (if the hull has more than 1 HP).

## Scrolls
There are 3 known types of magic in the world that can be inscribed in a spell scroll: Arcane, Divine, and Natural.  If you can cast at least one spell of first level or higher, you can use any spell scroll of the same type of magic.  Which type of caster you are depends on how you got your magic.  There are plenty of rarer types of magic as well, but those generally cannot be inscribed as scrolls.

If you have proficiency in Arcana, you can use Arcane spell scrolls even if you do not know any Arcane spells.  The same applies to Religion for Divine scrolls and Nature for Natural scrolls.  If you do not know any spells of the relevent casting type, you must make an Arcana, Religion, or Nature check to use the scroll, with disadvantage.  You must have proficiency in Arcana to scribe Arcane scrolls, Religion to scribe Divine scrolls, and Nature to scribe Natural scrolls.  You can only scribe scrolls for spells you have the ability to cast on your own.

## Spells Per Turn
If you cast more than one spell on your turn, their combined level must not add up to more than the highest level spell slot you have.  Cantrips count as level 0.

## Suffocation
You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + your Con modifier (minimum 30 seconds).  Every time you take damage while holding your breath, the number of rounds you have left is halved.  You immediately lose all your breath if you cast a spell using Verbal components, activate a magic item with a command word, or you are Incapacitated.  

If at the end of your turn you have no air left and wish to continue trying to hold your breath, make a Con save.  The DC starts at 10, then increases by 2 with each successive round of choking.  On a failure, you drop to 0 HP, becoming unconscious and unstable, and you cannot regain HP until you can breathe again.

## Surprise Rounds
The Surprised condition wears off after one full round has passed, instead of on a surprised creature's first turn

## Travel Paces
Pace | Speed | Effects
-----|-------|--------
Slow|2 days/hex|+5 to passive perception, can stealth
Standard|1 hex/day|cannot stealth
Fast|2 hexes/day|-5 to passive perception, cannot stealth, 1 point of exhaustion for every day of travel past the first.

Travel on roads is much safer than through the wilderness.  Difficult terrain (hills, forest) doubles travel time if not on a road.  When traveling at a fast pace on horseback or in a horse-drawn cart, the horses take the exhaustion instead of the riders.

On a ship, travel paces are listed in miles per hour.  Since each hex is 24 miles, the speed of the ship in mph is equal to the number of hexes it can travel per day at a normal pace.  Ships can travel at a slow pace to be stealthy or perceptive, but cannot travel faster without magical help.

## Weapon Classifications
The following weapons have been reclassified from Martial to Simple: Firearms, Shortswords

The following weapons have been reclassified from Simple to Martial: Javelins, Light Crossbows, Shortbows

## Week Length
Any spell or ability with a 7 day duration or cooldown has that time reduced to 6 days.

## Class Changes
* Artificer: We will be using the [Revised Artificer](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LAEn6ZdC6lYUKhQ67Qk) by KibblesTasty.
* Bard level 20 capstone: If you have spent one minute with no uses of bardic inspiration left and no other creatures having inspiration granted by you, you regain one use of bardic inspiration.
* Druids, while wildshaped, count as dual type Humanoid/Beast.
* Druid level 20 capstone: If at the start of your turn you have no uses of Wild Shape remaining and are not wildshaped, you regain 1 use of Wild Shape.
* Monk level 20 capstone: If you have less than 4 ki points remaining, you can spend an Action to center yourself and regain 1 ki point.
* Monk Weapons count as Finesse, including Unarmed Strikes
* Rangers of the Beast or Hunter conclave can use either the PHB or Revised Ranger stats.  If you choose the PHB Beastmaster, the subclass is changed as follows:
  * Your beast companion rolls its own initiative, and has its own Movement, Action, Bonus Action, and Reaction, though it loses multiattack (if it has one) until level 11.
  * At level 7, you can command your beast companion using your Bonus Action.  Your beast companion can immediately use its Reaction to take the Attack, Dash, Dodge, or Help actions.

## Feat Changes
* Lucky: Whenever more than one d20 was rolled for something, the circumstances of the original roll must be finalized before choosing between the original die and the Luck die.
* Tavern Brawler: With this feat, your Unarmed Strikes have the Finesse property.
* Sharpshooter: Instead of -5/+10, the tradeoff is -prof/+ 1d{2x prof} (e.g. -2/+1d4, -3/+1d6, etc.)
* Great Weapon Master: Instead of -5/+10, the tradeoff is -prof/+1d{2x prof} (e.g. -2/+1d4, -3/+1d6, etc.)
* Dual Wielder: if you can magically conjure or summon one weapon from a class feature, you can now conjure or summon two non-heavy weapons at once.

## Spell Changes
* Blade Ward: Duration extended to 1 minute, but requires concentration, and can be bypassed by magical weapon damage.
* Control Flames: Can be used on magical flames created by the caster or under the caster's control
* True Strike: Can be cast as a Bonus Action, and affects the next attack you make before the end of your next turn.
* Armor of Agathys: While you have the temporary HP, you also have resistance to cold damage.
* Ceremony: Invokes a spirit quest within the target(s)' mind related to the purpose of the casting.  The benefits of the spell only happen if this quest is successful.  If there is a skill check involved in the casting, the skill check's results determine the difficulty of the mission.  In addition, it is possible to use the Ceremony spell for more than just the listed uses, though the benefits (and risks) depend entirely on DM interpretation of the situation.
* Find Familiar: Familiar can take the form of any Tiny or Small CR 0 Beast that the caster has seen before
* Identify: Can identify cursed items if and only if the cursed item was enchanted with an equal or lower spell level than the one used to cast Identify.  Ritual casting Identify makes it count as 1st level.
* Witch Bolt: You can use a Bonus Action instead of an Action to deal the damage on subsequent turns, and the repeat damage is scaled with higher level spell slots
* Barkskin: Does not require concentration
* Find Steed: Steed can take the form of any Large or Medium Beast of CR 1 or lower, with no Fly or Swim speed, that the caster has seen before.
* Find Traps: All traps within line of sight glow until the end of your turn.
* Sending: You must have at least seen the person you are trying to contact and know at least one name they have gone by, though you need not have met them in person.  Additionally, if you use the Sending spell to contact someone who knows you by a fake identity, they interpret it as coming from the identity they know.  If the recipent knows multiple identities belonging to the caster but does not know that they are the same person, the caster can decide which identity the Sending spell will use.
* Find Greater Steed: Steed can take the form of any Large or Medium non-bipedal naturally-occuring creature of CR 2 or lower that the caster has seen before.
* Stoneskin: Grants resistance to non-siege Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing damage, and grants a damage threshold of 5 for all types of damage except for Force, Psychic, and Poison.
* Healing Spirit: Moving the spirit is free on your turn; healing requires a Bonus Action or Reaction.
* Mordenkainen's Sword: No action required for it to attack
* Plane Shift: The tuning fork requires about 250 gp in materials and a successful Smithing check to craft, but cannot be crafted without knowledge of the proper frequency for the target plane, which cannot be studied from anywhere but that plane.
