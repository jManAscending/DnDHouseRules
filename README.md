## Action Economy
It is possible to use an Action on your turn to use an ability that would normally be a Bonus Action or Reaction, and it is possible to use your Bonus Action on your turn to use an ability that would normally be your Reaction.  

## Cantrips
Apart from cantrips that have been selected via RAW, the cantrip list for each class can be treated as an extension of the class' first level spell list.  In addition, if you have the Spellcasting feature, you may swap out one cantrip from that class each time you gain a level in the class that grants it.

## Companion Creatures
If you have a telepathic connection with a companion creature that you control and that creature rolls initiative at the same time as you, that creature does not roll initiative for itself, and instead acts on your turn.

## Cursed Items
Cursed items have two main properties that set them apart from other magic items:
* They cannot be de-attuned (and sometimes cannot be physically removed) unless targeted by specific spells such as Remove Curse or Greater Restoration.
* They may or may not have abilities that are not learned at the time of initial attunement.

## Custom Backgrounds
You may choose any two skill proficiencies and one tool (or weapon) proficiency, if you don't think the ones provided by whichever background you choose fit your character's backstory.  If you really want to, I can also create a custom background feature for you, but bear in mind that I have screwed that up before.

## Crit Damage
If you choose to add dice from a resource or ability after you hit instead of before, the additional dice are not doubled if the attack is a critical.

## Downtime
You can use downtime to gain abilities beyond those listed in your class.  You must have some roleplay reason to want the abilities, a roleplay justification for how you're learning, and must describe at least partially what you are doing during downtime to train.  You may train on your own for free (minus required materials), but the training will go faster if you train under someone who has the feature you are training to get.  Each downtime day requires approximately 8 hours of training, and gives a number of Downtime Points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).

Ability | Points Required | Comments
-----|-------|--------
Weapon Proficiency|30|none
Firearm Proficiency|15|applies to firing, repairing requires tools
Language|60|none
Skill/Tool Proficiency|80|none
Skill/Tool Expertise|120|requires skill proficiency
Armor Proficiency|120|requires previous tier proficiency
Feat|240|you may get portions of the feat over time
Other Class Feature|variable|Depends on DM judgement calls

Each downtime day training under someone with proficiency will double the points you gain for that day.  If they have expertise in the tool/skill, it will count triple.  Prices for training may vary depending on in-story context.  If you want a specific class feature, it will require training under someone of the relevant class.

## Drawing Weapons Magically
If you have a class feature that says you can magically conjure or summon a weapon in your hand, it counts as a free object interaction, similar to actually drawing a weapon.

## Dual Creature Types
Some creatures may have 2 separate creature types, determined on a case-by-case basis by the DM.  As such, they are affected by anything that affects either of their creature types.  However, if one of their creature types is immune to an effect but the other isn't, the effect is reduced in a way determined by the DM.  For example, Warforged would be classified as both Construct and Humanoid, and would have advantage on saves vs Hold Person and similar magical effects.  

Planetouched races such as Tieflings and Aasimar (as well as Dhampirs) are considered purely Humanoid, but with non-humanoid heritage that is divinable by certain spells and magical effects.  Undead creatures will never retain any semblance of their previous creature type, apart from appearance.

## Enchanting
This world is going through a magical renaissance due to a homebrewed enchantment system.  This system is only relevent to those who have proficiency in Enchanter's Tools, and as such I will only bore you with the specifics upon request.  By default, Artificers and Wizards have proficiency in Enchanter's Tools, but the tool proficiency can be taken as part of a customized background.

## Extended Sourcebooks
All spells, all feats, and most backgrounds from the PHB, EE, XGE, and SCAG are available, though some have changes listed below.  Any backgrounds that are setting-specific and any UA material requires DM approval before using.  The current setting uses an extremely customized version of Artificer that takes advantage of my custom enchanting rules, but is currently undergoing serious reworking.  

Items not from official WotC material require heavy DM scutiny to be accepted, and may be reworked on the fly.  

## Fall Damage
Falling damage compounds: 1d6 per 10ft fallen, per 10ft fallen. (Example: falling 40ft will deal 4d6+3d6+2d6+1d6)

The maximum remains at 200ft, or 210d6.

If your speed is greater than 0 when you hit the ground, you can make a Dexterity saving throw (DC=10+{feet fell}/10) to reduce your effective fall distance by 10ft before damage is rolled.  Evasion does not apply to this save.

## Fallen Classes
If a Paladin, Cleric, or Warlock loses the favor of an entity that granted them powers, the player may have those powers stripped away.  All the character's levels in the relevent class will be replaced by one level of a "Fallen x" class.  The "Fallen x" class will include every nonmagical class feature the character had gained up until that point, including HP and Hit Dice, but not including Proficiency Bonus.  Subsequently gained levels in other classes will not grant new HP or Hit Dice until the character has surpassed the character level at which they fell, nor will they grant ASIs until the new classes' ASIs outnumebr the number of ASIs they has under the first class.  If the character does not already have levels in any other classes at the time they fall, they do not need to meet the ability score prerequisites to multiclass into any other class, but must still have a valid roleplay reason to multiclass.

## Firearms
Firearms in this campaign are based around the type of firearm used in Matt's Gunslinger subclass.  For right now, the firearm table in the 1.3 Gunslinger sheet is the canon firearm table for the setting.  The only difference between Artificer-made and Gunslinger-made firearms is the use of thunder magic instead of gunpowder.

A large part of the reason guns are becoming popular is the fact that it is much easier to learn how to use them than other ranged weapons, some of which can take a lifetime of training to use effectively.  To reflect this, firearm proficiency can be gained in half the time as other weapon proficiencies, though repairing them after a misfire still requires proficiency in an appropriate tool.

## Hit Points
When rolling a hit die on a level up, if the die lands on a 1, you may reroll it until it lands on anything else.

## Identifying Magic Items
An Arcana check may reveal whether an item has magical properties or not, and sometimes part of the nature of the magic if the effects are readily apparent.  Focusing on an item over a short rest does not reveal the nature of the item unless you attune to it.  
See the specific spell changes for information on Identify and Detect Magic.

Not all "Cursed" items have negative effects, and some "non-cursed" items may have negative effects.  Cursed items can be created either on purpose or by weird stuff happening in an enchantment ritual.

## Inspiration
When you spend your inspiration, you can get an ability or spell that your class will have in the next two levels, for up to one round.  If you are multiclassed, you instead choose an ability or spell one level ahead from any of your classes.  

If you are planning to multiclass with your next level, you may choose from the level 1 abilities of that class, but must use your next level to multiclass.  Similarly, if you use an ability that you would have had to choose when leveling, you are locked into that choice for when you reach that level, and cannot spend future inspiration on conflicting options.

## Incapacitation
If a creature is incapacitated for any reason, it cannot benefit from a DEX bonus to its AC.  
If a creature is indefinitely incapacitated and there is no other threat around, any lethal attack roll that would deal damage is an instant kill.  

## Milestone Leveling
XP will not be kept track of, or given out.  All PCs will be the same level, regardless of deaths, and the PCs will level upon a DM judgement call.  If a player is a Fallen Cleric, Paladin, or Warlock, they will gain levels slightly faster until they catch back up

## Multiclassing
If you want to multiclass, please let me know well in advance, and I will leave bread crumbs here and there for you.  You will need a roleplay reason to want to multiclass, and another roleplay excuse for how you will gain the new class features.  If you multiclass into any "learned" class, you will need to spend at least some downtime training for your new class features.  In the time directly leading up to and after your multiclass, I will slowly give you the level one features of that class depending on how you roleplay it.

## Ninth Level Spells
9th level spells can only be cast by literal Gods.  If you level up to the point where you have a 9th level spell slot and have the opportunity to learn a spell, it cannot be of 9th level.  However, you can still upcast lower level spells using your 9th level slot.

## Nonlethality
Range/melee does not affect lethality.  Psychic damage can be made nonlethal without issue; targets will drop to 0 and be stable.  Bludgeoning damage can be made nonlethal if it is the result of an attack roll, and targets will drop to 0 and be stable.  Necrotic damage canot be specified to be nonlethal.  All other types of damage can be made nonlethal if and only if the damage was dealt as the result of an attack roll.  If such an attack reduces the target to 0, the creature drops unconscious and unstable, making death saving throws according to player rules.  PCs at 0 HP will follow RAW for the most part, with one exception - if an NPC makes a nonlethal Bludgeoning or Psychic attack against a PC and they drop to 0, the PC will be immediately stable.

## Potions
Drinking a potion in combat is a bonus action.  Feeding a Potion to another character is an Action.  

## Preparing Spells
Spells can be prepared soon after the end of a long rest or during a short rest.  This process takes 1 minute per spell level per spell (both the spells you're preparing and un-preparing), and requires concentration and the ability to perform verbal and somatic components for the duration.  If a spell requires material components or a focus, it cannot be prepared without the material components or focus present.

## Ranged Dual Wielding
One-handed Light ranged weapons can be wielded in the off hand, and a bonus action can be used to attack as if using the Two Weapon Fighting mechanics.  
The ranged weapon does not have to be Light if the wielder has the Dual Wielder feat, but the +1 to AC will not apply unless both weapons are melee weapons.  
The Crossbow Expert feat does not apply to guns.  

## Scrolls
There are 3 known types of magic in the world that can be inscribed in a spell scroll: Arcane, Divine, and Natural.  If you can cast at least one spell of first level or higher, you can use any spell scroll of the same type of magic.  Which type of caster you are depends on how you got your magic.  There are plenty of rarer types of magic as well, but those generally cannot be inscribed as scrolls.

If you have proficiency in Arcana, you can use Arcane spell scrolls even if you do not know any first level Arcane spells.  If you do not know any Arcane spells, you must make an Arcana check to use it, with disadvantage.  You must have proficiency in Arcana to scribe a scroll of any kind.

## Spells Per Turn
If you cast more than one spell on your turn, their combined level must not add up to more than the highest level spell slot you have.  Cantrips count as level 0.

## Surprise Rounds
The Surprised condition wears off after one full round has passed, instead of on a surprised creature's first turn

## Travel Paces
Pace | Speed | Effects
-----|-------|--------
Slow|2 days/hex|+5 to passive perception, can stealth
Standard|1 hex/day|cannot stealth
Fast|2 hexes/day|-5 to passive perception, cannot stealth

Travel on main roads halves travel time, and is much safer than travel through wilderness.  Travel though difficult terrain (hills, forest) doubles travel time if not on a road.  Ships and Airships cannot travel at a Fast pace except with magical help.

## Week Length
Any spell or ability with a 7 day duration or cooldown has that time reduced to 6 days.

## Class Changes
* Artificer: Currently under serious review.  Will eventually have 3 completely revised subclasses: Gunsmith, Automaton Builder, and Alchemist. (Custom version was previously Engineer, Alchemist, and Enchanter)
* Bard level 20 capstone: If you have spent one minute with no uses of bardic inspiration left and no other creatures having inspiration granted by you, you regain one use of bardic inspiration.
* Druids, while wildshaped, count as dual type Humanoid/Beast.
* Druid level 20 capstone: If at the start of your turn you have no uses of Wild Shape remaining and are not wildshaped, you regain 1 use of Wild Shape.
* Monk level 20 capstone: If you have less than 4 ki points remaining, you can spend an Action to center yourself and regain 1 ki point.
* Rangers of the Beast or Hunter conclave can use either the PHB or Revised Ranger stats.  If you choose the PHB Beastmaster, the subclass is changed as follows:
  * Your beast companion rolls its own initiative, and has its own Movement, Action, Bonus Action, and Reaction, though it loses multiattack (if it has one) until level 11.
  * At level 7, you can command your beast companion using your Bonus Action.  Your beast companion can immediately use its Reaction to take the Attack, Dash, Dodge, or Help actions.

## Feat Changes
* Lucky: Whenever more than one d20 was rolled for something, the circumstances of the original roll must be finalized before choosing between the original die and the Luck die.
* Tavern Brawler: With this feat, your Unarmed Strikes have the Finesse property.
* Sharpshooter: Instead of -5/+10, the tradeoff is -prof/+ 1d{2x prof} (e.g. -2/+1d4, -3/+1d6, etc.)
* Great Weapon Master: Instead of -5/+10, the tradeoff is -prof/+1d{2x prof} (e.g. -2/+1d4, -3/+1d6, etc.)
* Dual Wielder: if you can magically conjure or summon one weapon from a class feature, you can now conjure or summon two non-heavy weapons at once.

## Spell Changes
* Magic Missile: If prepared as a first level spell, it can be cast as an Action without using a spell slot.  Casting it this way creates only a single dart.
* Teleportation Circle: No longer completely consumes the chalk and ink, but 50gp worth of chalk and ink lasts for at most 25 castings before they must be replaced (basically making it 2 gp per cast).
* Plane Shift: The tuning fork requires about 250 gp in materials and a successful Smithing check to craft, but cannot be crafted without knowledge of the proper frequency for the target plane, which cannot be studied from anywhere but that plane.  The more obscure the plane is and the further it is from the Prime Material, the more difficult the Smithing check to craft the rod.
* Armor of Agathys: While you have the temporary HP, you also have resistance to cold damage.
* Identify: Can identify cursed items if and only if the cursed item was enchanted with an equal or lower spell level than the one used to cast Identify.  Ritual casting Identify makes it count as 1st level.
* Detect Magic: Does not give the 'school' of magic, it instead gives the 'general nature' of the magic.  Sometimes this can be specific enough to identify the enchantment, other times it's more generic and useless than the school.
* Control Flames: Can be used on magical flames created by the caster or under the caster's control
* Find Steed: Steed can take the form of any Large or Medium Beast of CR 1 or lower, with no Fly or Swim speed, that the caster has seen before.
* Find Greater Steed: Steed can take the form of any Large or Medium non-bipedal naturally-occuring creature of CR 2 or lower that the caster has seen before.
* Find Familiar: Familiar can take the form of any Tiny or Small CR 0 Beast that the caster has seen before
* Barkskin: Does not require concentration
* Stoneskin: Grants resistance to non-siege Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing damage, and grants a damage threshold of 5 for all types of damage except for Force, Psychic, and Poison.
* Sending: You must have at least seen the person you are trying to contact and know at least one name they have gone by, though you need not have met them in person.  Additionally, if you use the Sending spell to contact someone who knows you by a fake identity, they interpret it as coming from the identity they know.  If the recipent knows multiple identities belonging to the caster but does not know that they are the same person, the caster can decide which identity the Sending spell will use.
* Healing Spirit: Moving the spirit is a free action on your turn; healing requires a Bonus Action.
* Ceremony: Invokes a spirit quest within the target(s)' mind related to the purpose of the casting.  The benefits of the spell only happen if this quest is successful.  If there is a skill check involved in the casting, the skill check's results determine the difficulty of the mission.  In addition, it is possible to use the Ceremony spell for more than just the listed uses, though the benefits (and risks) depend entirely on DM interpretation of the situation.
