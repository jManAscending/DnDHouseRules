## Changed Casting Stat
When you make a spellcasting character, multiclass into a spellcasting class, or otherwise gain the ability to cast spells from a class or feat, you may request for the class' spellcasting ability score to change to a different one, if you can give a solid justification for it.  For example, you may decide that your warlock gained their power through studying forgotten research of an eldritch entity, and thus uses Intelligence as their casting stat.  Once you start playing this character as a spellcaster, you may not change their casting stat.

If you are starting this character from level 1 with a different casting stat, you may change their starting saving proficiencies if they do not normally start with proficiency in saves from their new casting stat.  All characters must have one proficiency from the 3 more common saves (Dex, Wis, Con) and one proficiency from the 3 less common saves (Int, Cha, Str), so the save proficiency you replace must be in the same tier as your new casting stat.

## Character Creation
For your background, you may choose any two skill proficiencies and any two tool/weapon proficiencies or languages.  Instead of two skill proficiencies, you may choose one skill expertise. 

As this is a sci-fi/cyberpunk era campaign, background features have a lot of room to be reflavored and changed.  Many jobs exist now that didn't exist in any normal D&D world, so if you want a completely different homebrew background, just tell the DM what profession you want your character to be trained in, and we can work out what your background feature could be, and what equipment you could start with.

When rolling stats, use 4d6 drop lowest 6 times, and reroll all 6 if the total is less than 70.  If the total is over 70 but you still have no good stats, you can subtract 2 from one roll in exchange for adding 1 to another.  You can do this up to twice, and you cannot increase a roll beyond 18 with this bonus.

When creating a low-level character, you start with the equipment provided in your class features and background in addition to the starting wealth listed for your class.  When converting money between the PHB rules and the modern setting, 1sp = $1.

If you are creating a character at level 5 or higher, use the following table instead of your class' starting wealth:

Level | Money | Magic Items
-----|-------|--------
1-4|see class|none
5-8|$5,000 + 1d10×250|1 common
9-12|$25,000 + 1d10×1250|2 common, 1 uncommon
13-16|$50,000 + 1d10×2500|3 common, 2 uncommon
17-20|$200,000 + 1d10×10000|3 common, 2 uncommon, 1 rare

You can forgo getting two free magic items of one tier in order to start with one free magic item of a higher rarity tier.  For example, you could give up two uncommon items to start with one rare item.  This can stack with other free magic items; for example, at level 17 you could start with three common items and one very rare magic item.

You may spend starting wealth on whatever equipment you can afford before the first session.  This potentially includes more magic items, but you cannot combine purchased magic items with your free magic items to get higher tier items.  

See full guide [here](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LmJVKwpjP1DS_ufoH_i)

## Companion Creatures
If you have a telepathic connection with a companion creature that you control and that creature rolls initiative at the same time as you, that creature does not roll initiative for itself, and instead acts on your turn.

## Coup De Grace
If a creature is indefinitely incapacitated and there is no other threat around, any attack from within 5ft that would deal lethal damage to that creature automatically hits, and instantly reduces them to 0 HP.

## Criticals
On attack rolls, Critical Hits deal the normal damage for the attack, plus the maximum the dice could have rolled.  For example, if a weapon attack would normally deal 2d6+4 damage, a critical hit would deal 2d6+4+12 damage. This applies to all dice rolled as part of the attack hitting - even if the target had the opportunity to make a saving throw to avoid half of it (e.g. poisons).

On saving throws, Critical Successes automatically succeed, and Critical Failures automatically fail.

On contested ability checks, Critical Successes automatically win, and Critical Failures automatically lose.

On regular ability checks, criticals mean nothing.

## Downed Creatures
Creatures at 0 HP and Unstable are not fully Unconscious.  Instead, they are considered Prone and Stunned, meaning they are still somewhat aware of their surroundings and can speak falteringly.  Creatures at 0 HP and Stable are Unconscious.

Any purposeful attack against a downed creature at 0 HP from within 5ft will inflict 3 failed death saving throws instantly if it hits.

Failed death saving throws last until a creature's next long rest.  A creature can expend hit dice over a short rest to remove failed death saving throws (one die per saving throw).  Hit dice expended to remove a death saving throw restore no hit points.

Each time a creature drops to 0 HP, they gain a level of Exhaustion.  This rule does not apply to Path of the Zealot Barbarians.

## Downtime Crafting
If you have proficiency in an Artisan's Tool, You can spend downtime to craft a nonmagical object with that tool.  You must have raw materials equal to half the value of what you want to craft.  If what you are trying to craft costs $100 or less, you can complete it in one 8-hour workday.  Otherwise, each day you work on it you can make $100 worth of progress, and the item is completed when you have spent enough time on it to match its price.  If you have Expertise in the necessary tool, you can craft $200 worth of stuff per day.

Enchanting magic items has its own system, detailed in the homebrew spells document.

## Downtime Training
You can use downtime to gain abilities beyond those listed in your class.  You must have some roleplay reason to want the abilities, a roleplay justification for how you're learning, and must describe at least partially what you are doing during downtime to train.  Each downtime day requires approximately 8 hours of training, and gives a number of Downtime Points equal to your Intelligence score.  If you are training directly under someone who has the skill you are learning, you may add their proficiency bonus to your daily Downtime Points.

Ability | Points Required | Comments
-----|-------|--------
Simple Weapon Proficiency|60|none
Martial Weapon Proficiency|180|none
Tool Proficiency|300|none
Language|450|none
Skill Proficiency|600|none
Skill/Tool Expertise|900|requires skill proficiency
Armor Proficiency|900|requires previous tier proficiency
Half-Feat|900|feats that also give +1 to a stat; you don't get the +1 from the feat
+1 to an Ability Score|900|up to a maximum of 20
Feat|1800|you may get portions of the feat over time
Other Class Feature|variable|depends on DM judgement calls

You cannot train yourself from nothing.  In order to learn a new skill or ability, you either need to find reference material or a teacher.  Either way, it could end up being an expensive or involved process, depending on how you go about learning.

## Drawing Weapons Magically
If you have a class feature that says you can magically conjure or summon a weapon in your hand, it counts as a free object interaction, similar to actually drawing a weapon.

## Dual Creature Types
Some creatures may have 2 separate creature types, determined on a case-by-case basis by the DM.  As such, they are affected by anything that affects either of their creature types.  However, if one of their creature types is immune to an effect but the other isn't, the effect is reduced in a way determined by the DM.

Planetouched races such as Tieflings and Aasimar (including Warforged, for balance reasons) are considered Humanoid, but with non-humanoid influence that is divinable by certain spells and magical effects, and may affect how they react to certain abjuration magic.  Undead creatures will never retain any semblance of their previous creature type, apart from appearance.

## Extended Sources
Materials from all officially published WotC material are available, though some have changes listed in these rules.  All UA material, Stream content, and any features that are setting-specific require DM approval and possible modification before using.

Items not from official WotC material require heavy DM scutiny to be accepted, and may be reworked on the fly.

Currently accepted homebrew material:
* Matt Mercer's [Blood Hunter](http://www.dmsguild.com/product/175606/Order-of-the-Lycan-for-Blood-Hunters) + [Lycan subclass](http://www.dmsguild.com/product/175606/Order-of-the-Lycan-for-Blood-Hunters)

## Fall Damage
All creatures' fall damage caps at 500ft (50 dice), but the damage dice change based on the creature's size - the bigger you are, the harder you fall.
* Miniscule creatures take no damage from falling
* Tiny creatures take 1 damage, to a maximum of 50 points
* Small creatures take 1d4 damage, to a maximum of 50d4
* Medium creatures take 1d6 damage, to a maximum of 50d6
* Large creatures take 1d8 damage, to a maximum of 50d8
* Huge creatures take 1d10 damage, to a maximum of 50d10
* Gargantuan creatures take 1d12 damage, to a maximum of 50d12
* Colossal creatures take 1d20 damage, to a maximum of 50d20

If your speed is not 0 when you land, you can make a Dexterity saving throw (DC=10+{feet fell}/10) to reduce your effective fall distance and land upright instead of prone. If you succeed on this saving throw, you reduce the effective fall distance by 10ft. If you succeed by 5 or more, you can reduce the effective fall distance by 10ft for each 5 that you beat the DC by. For example, if you fall 50ft and roll a 25 Dex save, you can reduce the effective falling distance by 30ft, taking damage as if you fell 20ft.

For the purposes of resistance/immunity, falling deals nonmagical bludgeoning or piercing damage, depending on the surface you fall onto.

If a Tiny or larger creature or object falls onto another creature or object, half of the fall damage taken by the falling creature or object is also dealt to the target. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the damage. The saving throw DC starts at 10 for a Tiny object or creature, and increases by 2 for each size category it is above Tiny, up to a maximum of 20 for a Gargantuan or Colossal creature or object. If the falling creature/object is Collosal, creatures not within 10ft of the edge of the object automatically fail this saving throw unless they have some reasonable source of cover.

Creatures and objects normally fall at a rate of 500ft per round. For falls less than 500ft, the fall is treated as happening nearly instantly, though if a creature falls on their turn, they can use their Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction during the fall.

## Fallen Classes
If a Paladin breaks their oath, a Cleric loses the favor of their God, or a Warlock breaks their contract, the player may have those powers stripped away.  

All the character's levels in the relevent class will be replaced by one level of a "Fallen" class. The "Fallen" class will include every nonmagical class feature the character had gained up until that point, including HP and Hit Dice, but not including Proficiency Bonus.  Subsequently gained levels in other classes will not grant new HP or Hit Dice until the character has surpassed the character level at which they fell, nor will they grant ASIs until the new classes' ASIs outnumber the ASIs they had under the first class.  If the character does not already have levels in any other classes at the time they fall, they do not need to meet the ability score prerequisites to multiclass into any other class, but must still have a valid roleplay reason to take the new class.

## Foot Chases
Chases mostly follow normal combat rules, with the following exceptions:
* The initiative order is set based on relative positions (quarry goes first, followed by pursuers in order)
* At the end of each round, initiative is reset based on new relative positions
* At the start of each round, the DM may introduce an obstacle that everyone involved needs to deal with on their turn.  For examples, see the Chase Complications tables in the DMG.
* Opportunity Attacks cannot be used
* During a chase, a creature can use the Dash action freely a number of times equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier.  After this, each additional Dash requires a DC 10 Con check.  On a failure, the creature gains 1 level of Exhaustion.  Levels of Exhaustion gained this way can be removed over a short or long rest.

A chase ends if one of the following happens:
* The quarry is Grappled, Restrained, or otherwise prevented from moving by their pursuers
* The quarry has gained enough distance to be outside the maximum vision range of all pursuers
* The quarry is out of sight, and takes the Hide action, successfully hiding from their pursuers
* Either the quarry or all pursuers reach 5 levels of exhaustion
* Either the quarry or the pursuers purposely stop

When a chase ends, if normal combat follows, initiative is rolled at the end of the last round of the chase.

If a creature attempts to run away during normal combat, the chase begins at initiative count 0 after the first pursuer gives chase.  If the remaining creatures are still fighting each other, initiative count 0 separates the normal combat from the chase.

## Held Attacks
When you Ready an Attack action, your reaction attack benefits from the Extra Attack feature.

## Identifying Magic Items
An Arcana check may reveal whether an item has magical properties or not, and sometimes the nature of the enchantment if the effects are readily apparent.  Focusing on an item over a short rest does not reveal the nature of the item unless you attune to it.  

## Improvised Tools
If you wish to craft, repair, or manipulate something without tools specifically made for the job, you can attempt to do so with whatever you have access to, provided you can justify how you want it to work.  For example, you could make an improvised set of Thieves' Tools with bent wire, or an improvised set of Hacking Tools with scripts quickly downloaded off the internet.

When you make a check using improvised tools, you have disadvantage on the roll.

## Initiative
Every creature's base initiative bonus is their Dexterity modifier plus their Wisdom modifier.

## Inspiration
Spending inspiration allows you to treat one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw as if you had rolled a natural 20, though this does not count as a critical success.  You cannot choose to do this if you have already rolled.

## Leveling HP
When rolling a hit die on a level up, if the die lands on a 1, you may reroll it until it lands on anything else.

## Lingering Injuries
When damage would reduce you to 0 HP but not kill you outright, you can use a reaction to expend and roll one hit die, regaining hit points equal to what you rolled plus your Constitution modifier.  When you do so, you gain a point of Exhaustion, and you must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to the damage that put you to 0.  On a failure, you gain a [Lingering Injury](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LWu_LDHSZko9udS4vwN).

## Mage Duels
Whenever two spellcasters are in a 1v1 battle with no other threats, they enter a Mage Duel.  This acts mostly the same as a normal round of combat, but with the following additional rules:
* Every spell with a casting time of 1 Action or lower can be used as if it were Counterspell, if you can justify how the spell's effect nullifies the effect of your opponent's spell.  For example, you could cast Wall of Fire to shield yourself from a Cone of Cold.
* When casting a spell in this way, its casting time becomes one Reaction, and its duration becomes Instantaneous.
* Like Counterspell, countering in this way automatically works if the spell's level is greater than or equal to the level of the countered spell.
* Unlike Counterspell, if the countering spell was lower level, the two spellcasters make a contested check using their spellcasting ability to resolve the conflict.  If the lower level spell is a Cantrip, the person casting it has disadvantage on this check.
* If you have the Arcane Duelist feat, it applies to every spell you cast in this way.

Some organized dueling rings have optional rules layered on top of these, to make fights more interesting or more survivable.  Not all of these apply at every dueling ring, but these are the most common extra rules:
* The fight ends before either side reaches 0HP: some dueling rings stop when one side is Bloodied, while other, lower-level rings might only go to first blood.
* Necrotic damage is banned (and sometimes lethal damage entirely).
* Spells only - no other weapons or attacks
* If both sides run out of spell slots/spell points, the duel is a draw.
* Counterspell and Dispel Magic are banned (come on, be more creative).

## Milestone Leveling
XP will not be kept track of, or given out.  All PCs will be the same level, and the PCs will level up according to DM judgement call.  If a player controls a Fallen character, they will gain levels slightly faster until they catch back up.

In the event of Total Plot Derailment followed by a Total Party Kill, the next set of characters you create may or may not be at a completely different level.

## Multiclassing
If you want to multiclass, please let the DM know before you level up, so that plot hooks can be made available for you.  You will need a roleplay reason to want to multiclass, and another roleplay excuse for how you will gain the new class features.  If you multiclass into any "learned" class, you will need to spend at least some downtime training for your new class features.  In the time directly leading up to and after your multiclass, you may gain the level one features slowly or at specific moments as they become relevant through roleplay.  You will only gain the Hit Points and Hit Dice from your multiclass when you actually level up.

The multiclass prerequisites can be modified or ignored depending on your primary ability scores for your build.  For example, you do not need 13 Str to multiclass as a paladin if you use Dexterity for all your attack rolls, but you would need 13 Dex.  Personally, I am much more lenient with the prerequisites to multiclass out of a class than the prerequisites for multiclassing into a class.

## Nonlethal Damage
Range does not affect lethality.  Psychic and Lightning damage can be made nonlethal without issue; targets will drop to 0 and be stable.  Bludgeoning damage can be made nonlethal if it is the result of an attack roll, and targets will drop to 0 and be stable.  Necrotic damage cannot be specified to be nonlethal.  

All other types of damage can be made nonlethal if the damage was dealt as the result of an attack roll.  If such an attack reduces the target to 0 HP, the creature becomes Unstable, making death saving throws according to player rules.  

Player Characters at 0 HP will follow RAW for the most part, with one exception - if a PC takes nonlethal Bludgeoning, Lightning, or Psychic damage and they drop to 0, the character will be immediately stable.

## Planar Boundaries
All spells which can supposedly affect anything on the same plane as you, but cannot target anything on different planes (e.g. Teleport, Dream), can instead only affect targets on the same 'layer' of whatever plane you are on.  Each plane has a different definition of 'layer':
* On the Prime Material, this refers to individual planets.
* The Feywild and Shadowfell have different individual planets as well, mirroring the Prime Material's
* Under the Great Wheel cosmology, The Elemental Planes were once part of one large plane called the Elemental Torus, with nigh uninhabitable border regions between the quadrants.  Now, in the World Tree, each one is a separate plane, each with 1 layer.
* The Ethereal Depths is its own 'layer', as is every instance of the Border Ethereal
* The Astral Sea has no innate layers, but artificial "layers" have been magically created (e.g. Bags of Holding and the Demiplane spell)
* The Outer Planes each have their own unique and weird structures (results may vary)

The Gate spell can still connect to whichever layer you want, so long as your destination is not magically warded from planar travel.  Plane Shift can only take you to the first or 'primary' layer of that plane (e.g. you can plane shift to Avernus, but not Dis).

## Potions
Drinking a potion in combat is a bonus action.  Feeding a Potion to another character is an Action.

## Preparing Cantrips
Apart from cantrips that have been selected normally, the cantrip list for each class can be treated as an extension of the class' first level spell list.  In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, you may swap out one cantrip each time you gain a level in the class that grants it.

## Preparing Spells
Spells can be prepared at the end of a long rest or during a short rest.  This process takes 1 minute per spell level per spell (both the spells you're preparing and un-preparing), and requires concentration and the ability to perform verbal and somatic components for the duration.  If a spell requires material components or a focus, it cannot be prepared without the material components or focus present.

## Quick Actions
It is possible to use an Action on your turn to use an ability that would normally be a Bonus Action or Reaction, and it is possible to use your Bonus Action on your turn to use an ability that would normally be your Reaction.  

## Ranged Dual Wielding
One-handed Light ranged weapons can be wielded in the off hand, and a bonus action can be used to attack as if using the Two Weapon Fighting mechanics.  

The ranged weapon does not have to be Light if the wielder has the Dual Wielder feat, but the +1 to AC will not apply unless both weapons are melee weapons.  

## Resurrection
After being resurrected via Revivify, Raise Dead, or similar magic, you permanently have one failed death save.  After being resurrected twice, you have two permanently failed death saves.  After being resurrected for a third time, the next time you would normally be at 0 HP and unstable, you die instantly and cannot be revived.  This restriction does not apply to Zealot Barbarians, the Reincarnate spell, or Undead.

## Scrolls
There are 3 known types of magic in the world that can be inscribed in a spell scroll: Arcane, Divine, and Natural.  If you can cast at least one spell of first level or higher, you can use any spell scroll of the same type of magic.  Which type of caster you are depends on how you got your magic.  There are rarer types of magic as well, but those generally cannot be inscribed as scrolls.

If you have proficiency in Arcana, you can use Arcane spell scrolls even if you do not know any Arcane spells.  The same applies to Religion for Divine scrolls and Nature for Natural scrolls.  If you do not know any spells of the relevent casting type, or if you do not have a spell slot high enough to cast the scribed spell, you must make an Arcana, Religion, or Nature check to use the scroll.

## Size
There are two new homebrew sizes with unique properties: Miniscule and Colossal

**Miniscule:** One size category below Tiny. Miniscule entities are incredibly small, and can fit through gaps 1 inch wide without squeezing. Creatures this size have their base carry capacity halved twice, and do not take or deal damage from falling. This size category is intended for insects and similarly-sized creatures/objects.

**Colossal:** One size category above Gargantuan. Creatures, Vehicles, and other Objects that take up spaces larger than 30ft x 30ft are considered Colossal. Colossal entities cannot be grappled except by other colossal entities, and on a battlemap are treated more as terrain than as an actual singular entity. They usually follow the same action economy rules as other creatures and vehicles, but generally have different sets of hit points for different parts of them.  For example, a colossal sailing ship might have a separate HP pool for its hull and sails (or even separate HP pools for separate segments of its hull), or a plane may have separate HP pools for its wings and fuselage. The largest of creatures and vehicles may even have different hit point pools for different Large or Huge sections of a single segment.

## Speed
Every character gets a bonus to their speed equal to 5 times their Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier, whichever's lowest.  If one of those ability modifiers is negative, then the speed bonus is 0.  If both ability modifiers are negative, the penalty equals 5 times the higher bonus.

## Spells Per Turn
If you cast more than one spell on your turn, their combined level must not add up to more than the highest level spell you are able to cast or the highest level spell slot you have (whichever's higher).  Cantrips count as level 0.

## Suffocation
You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + your Con modifier (minimum 30 seconds, or 5 rounds).  Every time you take damage while holding your breath, the number of rounds you have left is halved (rounding down).  You immediately lose all your breath if you cast a spell using Verbal components, activate a magic item with a command word, or you are Incapacitated.  

If at the end of your turn you have no air left and continue trying to hold your breath, you must make a Constitution saving throw.  The DC starts at 10, then increases by 2 with each successive round of choking.  On a failure, you drop to 0 HP, becoming Unstable, and you cannot regain HP until you can breathe again.

## Surprise Rounds
The Surprised condition wears off after one full round has passed, instead of on a surprised creature's first turn.

## Taking Ten
When in a non-stressful situation where you can repeat a skill check for an arbitrary amount of time, you can choose to use your passive skill in place of an active skill check. For example, this can apply to searching a room for hidden doors or compartments, studying a topic in a library over downtime, or crafting an item that you have crafted before.

If you would have advantage on the check, your passive score increases by 5 for that check, and vice versa for disadvantage.

## Tattoos
The magic tattoos from Tasha's Cauldron are available, but are not flavored as described in the items' descriptions.  Instead, they are created using tattoo ink infused with residuum, and effectively must be applied by a tattoo artist casting Enchant Magic Item using a specialized tattoo needle that is itself enchanted to handle the residuum.  Unattuning from a tattoo does not result in the tattoo disappearing, but does result in being unable to use the tattoo's magical properties, and the tattoo will fade to be almost invisible.  The tattoo will also temporarily fade inside an Antimagic Field.

Spellwrought tattoos can be created without casting Enchant Magic Item, but do disappear completely once used.  Applying one requires a skill check, similar to crafting an expendable magic item.

Tattoos can only be applied to skin.  Depending on cybernetic augmentations, this may limit the number and location of potential tattoos.

## Vehicle Combat
When starting a vehicle from a full stop, it cannot move further than its Combat speed that turn.  After the first turn, it can accelerate up to its top speed.  If a vehicle is traveling in a straight line, or making a 45 degree or less turn, it can be going any speed up to its top speed, chosen by the driver when they use their Action to control the vehicle.  In order to be able to make tighter turns, the vehicle cannot go above its Combat speed.  Some vehicles that are hard to turn may not have a combat speed, in which case it can never turn more than 45 degrees in one round.

If the vehicle is in manual control mode, one creature must use an Action every round to drive the vehicle.  When doing so, the driver decides what speed the vehicle is going, and moves the vehicle.  If an entire round passes with nobody driving, the vehicle swerves and may crash.  The driver may need to make an ability check each round to control the car in heavy traffic or other adverse conditions, with a DC depending on their speed and the obstacles.

If the vehicle is in autopilot mode, the AI will act on initiative count 20, obeying all traffic laws and driving as safely as possible.  If the autopilot has been hacked, then what happens depends on what the hacker attempts to make the vehicle do.  A hacker may decide to give the vehicle false information or change its destination, in which case the AI would still act on initiative count 20.  Alternatively, a hacker could take complete control of the vehicle, in which case the hacker would be considered equivalent to a manual driver.

If a vehicle in motion hits an obstacle, whether that obstacle is a creature, another vehicle, or some other object, both the obstacle and the vehicle take bludgeoning damage from the impact equal to the fall damage that the vehicle would take from falling a number of feet equal to their current speed in mph.  If the obstacle is not reduced to 0 HP from this impact, the vehicle crashes and stops moving.  If the obstacle is a creature or another vehicle that is being controlled, that target can potentially dodge the crash.  If the impact was on purpose, the driver/pilot must make an attack roll using the vehicle's Dexterity.  Otherwise, the target must make a Dex save, against a DC equal to 10 + (the vehicle's speed in mph)/10.  On a missed attack, or on a successful save, the vehicle does not impact the target.

If a Huge or smaller vehicle takes bludgeoning or thunder damage, whether that damage is the result of a crash or not, half that damage is also dealt to all creatures in the vehicle.  If a Gargantuan or Colossal vehicle takes damage, what happens to the passengers depends on their positioning within the vehicle and where the damage happened.  This damage can be further reduced by safety devices such as airbags and seat belts.

If a vehicle has the Open property and no seat belts, harnesses, or similar mechanism, crashes will fling the passengers from the vehicle instead of transferring the damage.  The amount of damage the passengers then take is decided by the DM depending on where they were flung and how fast.

## Week Length
All abilities which normally last for or recharge after 7 days have that duration shortened to 6 days.

## Class Changes
* Artificer (KibblesTasty): The Cannonsmith's Thunder Cannon uses the base stats of a Hunting Rifle.
* Bard level 20 capstone: If you have spent one minute with no uses of bardic inspiration left and no other creatures having inspiration granted by you, you regain one use of bardic inspiration.
* Druid:
  * While wildshaped, you count as dual type Humanoid/Beast.
  * Level 20 capstone: If at the start of your turn you have no uses of Wild Shape remaining, you regain 1 use of Wild Shape.
* Monk:
  * Level 20 capstone: If you have less than 4 ki points remaining, you can spend an Action to center yourself and regain 1 ki point.
  * Monk Weapons count as Finesse, including Unarmed Strikes
* Rangers of the Beast or Hunter conclave can use either the PHB or Revised Ranger stats.  If you choose the PHB Beastmaster, the subclass is changed as follows:
  * Your beast companion rolls its own initiative and has its own turn, though it loses multiattack (if it has one) until level 11.
  * At level 7, you can command your beast companion using your Bonus Action.  Your beast companion can immediately use its Reaction to take the Attack, Dash, Dodge, or Help action.
* Rogue: Sneak Attack damage dice increase in size when you reach certain levels in the Rogue class: d8s at 5th level, d10s at 11th level, and d12s at 17th level.
* Monk/Rogue: Evasion doesn't apply if your movement is 0.
* Sorcerer:
  * Instead of learning metamagic options permanently, you can prepare 2 metamagic options from the list of available ones at the end of a long rest. This increases at 10th and 17th level, in line with where RAW sorcerers learn more options.
  * You may use the Spell Points system instead of Spell Slots for your sorcerer Spellcasting.
  * If your sorcerer subclass does not have a feature at level 1 giving you bonus spells, you gain the Origin Spells feature, giving you more known spells from 1st to 5th level based on your specific subclass.  See [this document](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MiDX1WprrjtW-LMYtSW).
* Warlock: The Hexblade subclass does not allow you to use Charisma for weapon attacks and damage.  Instead, that feature is part of Pact of the Blade, which can be taken by any Warlock at level 3.

## Feat Changes
* Dual Wielder: If you can magically conjure or summon one weapon from a class feature, you can now conjure or summon two non-heavy weapons at once.
* Grappler: If a creature you are grappling is your size or smaller, you can attempt to throw that creature with an Athletics check, contested by the target's Athletics or Acrobatics.  If you succeed, you can throw the creature a number of feet horizontally equal to your strength modifier × 5 (minimum 5ft), or half that distance vertically.  The maximum distance you can throw a creature doubles for each size category it is smaller than you.
* Heavy Armor Master: Damage reduction applies to magical weapon damage as well.
* Lucky: Whenever more than one d20 was rolled for something, the circumstances of the original roll must be finalized before choosing between the original die and the Luck die.
* Tavern Brawler: With this feat, your Unarmed Strikes have the Finesse property.
* Weapon Master: In addition to the weapon proficiencies, grants a Fighting Style.

## Spell Changes
* Blade Ward: Duration extended to 1 minute, but requires concentration, and can be bypassed by magical weapon damage.
* Control Flames: Can be used on magical flames created by the caster or under the caster's control
* True Strike: Can be cast as a Bonus Action, and affects the next attack you make before the end of your next turn.
* Armor of Agathys: While you have the temporary HP, you also have resistance to cold damage.
* Ceremony: Invokes a spirit quest within the target(s)' mind related to the purpose of the casting.  The benefits of the spell only happen if this quest is successful.  If there is a skill check involved in the casting, the skill check's results determine the difficulty of the mission.  In addition, it is possible to use the Ceremony spell for more than just the listed uses, though the benefits (and risks) depend entirely on DM interpretation of the situation.
* Find Familiar: Familiar can take the form of any Tiny CR 0 creature.
* Identify: Can identify cursed items if and only if the cursed item was enchanted with an equal or lower spell level than the one used to cast Identify.  Ritual casting Identify makes it count as 1st level.
* Mage Armor: The target's base AC becomes 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier + its Dexterity modifier.
* Witch Bolt: The repeat damage is scaled with higher level spell slots.
* Barkskin: AC increased to 17; does not require concentration.
* Find Steed: Steed can take the form of any Large or Medium Beast of CR 1 or lower, with no Fly or Swim speed, that the caster has seen before.
* Find Traps: All traps within line of sight glow until the end of your turn.
* Dispel Magic: Can only dispel one spell per cast.  You must specify what spell you are dispelling (you do not necessarily need to know exactly what the spell is, only that it's there).  Also may be able to dispel other magical effects or properties, with a DC dependent on DM judgement.
* Sending: You must have at least seen the person you are trying to contact and know at least one name they have gone by, though you need not have met them in person.  Additionally, if you use the Sending spell to contact someone who knows you by a fake identity, they interpret it as coming from the identity they know.  If the recipent knows multiple identities belonging to the caster but does not know that they are the same person, the caster can decide which identity the Sending spell will use.  Also, modern technology can intercept Sending messages, like unencrypted radio signals.
* Summon Lesser/Greater Demon: These spells are banned.  Not for balance reasons - the Abyss just happened to get thrown into a black hole.
* Find Greater Steed: Steed can take the form of any Large or Medium non-bipedal creature of CR 2 or lower that the caster has seen before.
* Stoneskin: Grants resistance to non-siege Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing damage, and grants 5 poins of damage reduction for all types of damage except for Force, Psychic, and Poison.
* Mordenkainen's Sword: No action required for it to attack
* Plane Shift: The tuning fork requires about 250 gp in materials and a successful Smithing check to craft, but cannot be crafted without knowledge of the proper frequency for the target plane, which cannot be studied from anywhere but that plane.  In addition, Plane Shift can only take you to a location on the plane's first or primary layer/planet.
