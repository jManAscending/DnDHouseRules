## Nonlethality
Range/melee does not affect lethality.  Psychic damage can be made nonlethal without issue; targets will drop to 0 and be stable.  Bludgeoning damage can be made nonlethal if it is the result of an attack roll, and targets will drop to 0 and be stable.  Necrotic damage canot be specified to be nonlethal.  Piercing, Slashing, and all other types of elemental damage can be made nonlethal if and only if the damage was dealt as the result of an attack roll.  If such an attack reduces the target to 0, the creature drops unconscious and unstable, making death saving throws according to player rules.  PCs at 0 HP will follow RAW for the most part, with one exception - if an NPC makes a nonlethal Bludgeoning or Psychic attack against a PC and they drop to 0, the PC will be immediately stable.

## Incapacitated damage
If a creature is incapacitated for any reason, it cannot benefit from a DEX bonus to its AC
If a creature is indefinitely incapacitated and there is no other threat around, any lethal attack roll that would deal damage is an instant kill
If a creature is incapacitated in the middle of active combat, any attack has advantage, and any melee hit or point-blank ranged hit is a critical
If a creature is incapacitated for an arbitrary amount of time but will not be incapacitated once attacked (e.g. sleeping), any attack has advantage, and any hit is a critical

## Prone creatures
Tiles with Prone creatures count as Difficult Terrain
A creature cannot willingly drop Prone if it is occupying a Prone creature's space; if it is forced to go Prone by an effect, it is pushed 5ft away in a direction that makes sense for the effect.
If a creature is occupying a Prone creature's space, the Prone creature has half-cover
If a hostile creature is occupying a Prone creature's space, the Prone creature cannot stand up until it is in a space of its own
A Prone creature can make a Shove attack on a creature occupying its space without disadvantage

## Dual Wielding
One-handed Light ranged weapons can be wielded in the off hand, and a bonus action can be used to attack (without your proficiency bonus, and still without adding the modifier to damage)
Any one-handed or versatile ranged weapon can be wielded in the off hand with proficiency (if applicable) if the wielder has the Dual Wielder feat (though the +1 to AC will not apply unless dual wielding melee weapons)
Note: it still takes an extra bonus action to draw a second weapon at the start of combat without the Dual Wielding feat, and you still need both hands to load a crossbow or gun
The Crossbow Expert feat does not apply to guns
As in RAW, at least one hand must still be free to provide somatic components for a spell, unless the spellcaster has the War Caster feat

## Enchanting
Enchanting an item first requires that you understand the formula for putting that enchantment on that item and are able to cast the spell you are trying to enchant the item with.
Cantrip enchantments are incredibly cheap and usually only take a single ritual that takes an hour + the casting time of the spell (though it does require you know the spell you're enchanting with)
Higher level spells are more difficult, and require more than one performance of the enchanting ritual (potentially becoming ridiculously expensive for spells which require costly material components)
Most of the uses of the ritual will be to prepare the item to recieve the enchantment in a final ritual potentially taking way longer (anywhere from 3 to 13 hours)
There is no limit to how many times you can perform the preparation ritual other than spell slots and time
There is always a chance the final ritual will fuck up royally; the chance gets exponentially higher with high level spells and steadily lower with more casts of the preparation ritual
Consumables such as scrolls and potions are similarly easy to craft
For more information, I have a whole goddamn homebrewed encyclopedia to reference on this one

## Disenchanting
It is possible to learn an item's enchantment formula by disenchanting it if you are proficient in Arcana.  This will most likely destroy the item beyond repair, and is not guaranteed to actually teach you the full formula.
If you wish to get rid of the enchantment on an item without breaking it, there are two ways:
* Performing the enchantment ritual with the Dispel Magic spell, and making an Arcana check with a DC of 10 + spell level
* Breaking the object and fixing it again, either with Mending or just plain glue 

## Actions and Spells in Combat
It is possible to use an Action on your turn to use an ability that would normally be a Bonus Action or Reaction, and it is possible to use your Bonus Action on your turn to use an ability that would normally be your Reaction.  Reactions will refresh at the start of your turn (meaning if you use a Reaction on your turn, you cannot take another until the start of your next turn).  If you cast more than one spell on your turn, their combined level must not add up to more than the highest level spell slot you have.  Cantrips count as level 0.

## Potions
Drinking a potion in combat is a bonus action.  Feeding a Potion to another character is an Action.  If you are currently under the effect of at least one potion or if you have already drank a potion this turn, drinking another will require a Consititution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the combined spell levels of all relevent potions.  On a success, the new potion takes effect.  On a failure you throw up, can't benefit from the new potion, and attacks against you have advantage until the start of your next turn.

## Identifying Magic Items
An Arcana check can reveal whether an item has magical properties or not, and sometimes part of the nature of the magic if the effects are readily apparent.  Focusing on an item over a short rest does not reveal the nature of the item unless you attune to it.

See the specific spell changes for information on Identify and Detect Magic.

## Cursed Items
Cursed items have two main properties that set them apart from other magic items:
* They cannot be de-attuned (and sometimes cannot be physically removed) unless targeted by specific spells such as Remove Curse or Greater Restoration.
* They may or may not have abilities that are not learned at the time of initial attunement.

Not all "Cursed" items have negative effects, and some "non-cursed" items may have negative effects.  Cursed items can be created either on purpose or by weird stuff happening in an enchantment ritual.

## Preparing Spells
Spells can be prepared soon after the end of a long rest or during a short rest.  This process takes 1 minute per spell level per spell (both the spells you're preparing and un-preparing), and requires concentration and the ability to perform verbal and somatic components for the duration.  If a spell requires material components or a focus, it cannot be prepared without the material components or focus present.

## Extra Spells
All spells listed on https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/spells/ are canon (both from the PHB and EE), and can be used by PCs and NPCs alike.  The only exception is 9th level spells, which don't exist in this world yet.  If any character reaches the point where they have a 9th level spell slot, they are among the most powerful casters in the world.

## Cantrips as 1st Level Spells
Apart from cantrips that have been selected via RAW, the cantrip list for each class can be treated as an extension of the class' first level spell list.

## Social Encounters
NPCs and PCs will almost never roll for Persuation against PCs.  Instead, PCs have to be persuaded by actually persuading the character's player.  The only exception to this is if the PC is Charmed or under the influence of the Friends cantrip, in which case a Persuation check can be made without advantage.  Both PCs and NPCs will only have to roll for Deception when contested by another character's active Insight check.

## Reviving Creatures
Spells which bring a lost soul back from the Astral Plane will automatically succeed if and only if the soul is able and willing to return.  If the soul is not willing, a spellcasting ability check must be performed by the caster against the deceased creature's passive WIS save.  On a success, the soul will be forced back by the terms of the spell.  If this check fails or if the soul is not available in the Astral Plane to be retrieved, the spell consumes its components and ends without any effect.

## Travel Paces
Pace | Speed | Effects
-----|-------|--------
Slow|2 days/hex|+5 to passive perception, can stealth
Standard|1 hex/day|cannot stealth
Fast|2 hexes/day|-5 to passive perception, cannot stealth

Travel on roads halves travel time.  Travel though difficult terrain (hills, forest) doubles travel time if not on a road.

## Specific Spell Changes
* Magic Missile: If prepared as a first level spell, it can be cast as an Action without using a spell slot.  Casting it this way creates only a single dart.
* Teleportation Circle: No longer completely consumes the chalk and ink, but the chalk and ink lasts for at most 50 castings before they must be replaced (basically making it 1 gp per cast).  Permanent Circles can be created using the homebrewed Enchantment rules (likely requiring up to about 85 casts of the spell, each one in an hour-long ritual except the last one which is 7 hours long, costing around 85 gp) or by RAW (casting it every day for a year, each cast taking 1 minute and in total costing around 365 gp)
* Forbiddance: Similar to TC, can be made permanent either via the homebrew system (taking up to about 148 castings, but not consuming the components) or by RAW (casting it 30 days in a row and having the spell absorb the components)
* Plane Shift: Attuning the forked rod to other planes is a very precise process that requires either good research or experimentation.  The resonant frequency of the Material Plane is known by high-level casters and not that difficult to research if you know where to look, but the resonant frequency of other planes is still being studied.  The rod itself costs about 250 gp in materials and a successful Tinkering check to craft, but cannot be crafted without knowledge of the proper frequency for the target plane, which cannot be studied from anywhere but that plane.  The more obscure the plane is and the further it is from the Prime Material, the more difficult the Tinkering check to craft the rod.
* Armor of Agathys: While you have the temporary HP, you also have resistance to cold damage.
* Identify: Can identify curses if and only if the cursed item was enchanted with an equal or lower spell level than the one used to cast Identify.  Ritual casting Identify makes it count as 1st level.
* Detect Magic: Does not give the 'school' of magic, it instead gives the 'general nature' of the magic.  Sometimes this can be specific enough to identify the enchantment, other times it's more generic and useless than the school.
* Control Flames: Can be used on magical flames under the caster's control

## Feat Changes
* Lucky: Whenever more than one d20 was rolled for something, the circumstances of the original roll must be finalized before choosing between the original die and the Luck die.  For example, if you roll with disadvantage and then use Luck, you cannot choose the higher of the two original rolls - you have to choose between the lower of the original ones or the Luck die.
